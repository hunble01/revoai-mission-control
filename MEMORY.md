## RevoAI — Business Source of Truth (v1)

### One-liner
RevoAI helps local businesses turn missed calls, DMs, and ad clicks into booked appointments using an AI receptionist, website chatbox, high-converting landing pages, and instant follow-up automation connected to booking and reminder workflows.

### Core Offer
RevoAI delivers an “AI Receptionist + Ad-to-Appointment” system:
1. AI receptionist (missed-call text-back, qualification, routing, handoff)
2. AI website chatbox (FAQ, lead capture, booking guidance)
3. Conversion-focused landing pages (offer-specific, mobile-first, CTA-driven)
4. Instant follow-up automations (SMS/email/DM, 30–60s response target)
5. Booking + reminder workflows (Calendly/Acuity/Square/etc.)
6. No-show/lost-lead recovery + optional reactivation
7. Custom automations (quotes/intake/deposits/routing/integrations)

### Primary Outcome
Increase booked appointments from existing lead flow by improving:
- speed-to-lead
- booking conversion rate
- no-show reduction
- recovered bookings
Core KPI: booked appointments generated from inbound lead flow.
No guaranteed revenue claims.
