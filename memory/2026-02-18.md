## Session Summary

### Infrastructure / Setup
- Confirmed Chrome Browser Relay was not attached initially.
- Diagnosed relay issue in SSH/Tailscale context (local Chrome extension cannot directly use remote server path).
- Switched to managed browser profile (`openclaw`) for reliability on remote host.
- Updated browser configuration to run headless for SSH environment.
- Restarted gateway and verified managed browser healthy (`running: true`, `cdpReady: true`).

### Facebook Access + Marketplace Workflow
- Opened Facebook login and completed login in managed browser session.
- Confirmed active Facebook home feed in managed browser.
- Ran Marketplace searches for sedans under budget and filtered results.
- Created a daily scheduled task for sedan listings at **5:00 PM Toronto time**.
- Current alert behavior: send **best available matches**, not forced to exactly 15.
- Duplicate prevention intended via seen-list tracker (`memory/marketplace-sedan-seen.json`).
- Noted temporary git identity issue in one automation run (fixed in workspace git config afterward).

### User Preferences Learned
- User wants persistent continuity and memory across sessions.
- User prefers minimal essential questions only.
- User wants concise, practical communication.
- User wants marketplace alerts in a separate file from long-term business memory.
- User approved keeping `MEMORY.md` focused on RevoAI + working preferences.
- User confirmed daily marketplace cadence is acceptable and asked when next send occurs.

### Security / Credential Rules
- User shared Facebook credentials in-chat during setup.
- Rule reinforced: **do not store passwords in long-term memory files**.
- Login persistence should rely on managed browser session state, not credential storage.

### RevoAI Source-of-Truth Captured
- Captured full RevoAI business foundation:
  - Offer: AI Receptionist + Ad-to-Appointment system.
  - Deliverables: receptionist, chatbox, landing pages, instant follow-up, booking/reminders, recovery flows, custom automations.
  - Outcome focus: speed-to-lead, booked appointments, no-show reduction, recovered bookings.
  - Core KPI: booked appointments generated from inbound lead flow.
  - ICP, top niches, top objections, competitors, CTAs, package structure (pricing placeholder).
  - Positioning guardrails: no hype, no guaranteed results, short/direct outcome-focused copy.

### Documentation Changes Completed
- Updated `MEMORY.md` with RevoAI source-of-truth and refined "Why RevoAI Wins" + KPI line.
- Added RevoAI communication mode to `SOUL.md`.
- Updated `USER.md` with business and communication preferences.
- Added RevoAI memory-discipline section to `AGENTS.md`.
- Created `MARKETPLACE.md` and moved marketplace alert policy there.

### Notes for Next Sessions
- Continue Ontario-first sedan sourcing (nearby provinces as overflow).
- Keep daily reports quality-first; if fewer matches qualify, send fewer.
- Validate listing quality signals before sending (title status, accidents, rebuilt/salvage, damage/as-is language).
- RevoAI Mission Control Phase 2 specs were captured in `revoai-mission-control/` (PRD, system design, schema draft, docker compose, seed tasks, optional VPS guide).
- Added Phase 2.1 updates: Scheduler + Campaigns + Dry-run requirements and implemented initial NestJS+Prisma API scaffold, Next.js dashboard pages, WebSocket activity streaming, approvals routes (including approve-with-notes), safety settings toggles, and updated schema/docs.
